This is my https://neovim.io/[Neovim] configuration, there are many like
it, but this one is mine.  Feel free to check it out.  Follow @dgcode on
Twitter for updates (uses github hook)


== Installation

This assumes no previous install of a vim configuration.

----
    git clone git://github.com/dubgeiser/vimconfig.git <VIMDIR>
    nvim
----

When entering the editor, vim-plug is automatically fetched and it'll try to
install all the plugins.
I had not much success with this (my first thought is that the `VimEnter` event
is triggered too late, but I haven't investigated this further.
If you get errors and/or nu plugins seem to be loaded, issue

----
    :PlugInstall
    :q
----

and start Neovim again.
