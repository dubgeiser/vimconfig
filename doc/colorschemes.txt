*colorschemes.txt* Color schemes I've tried out.


                                                                     *gruvbox*
Nice one, switched to it after using Solarized (light and dark) for years.
Like the dark version a lot.
Modern color scheme, good diff highlighting, gitcommit, quickfix, etc...
It has replaced Solarized as from 2018-12-05

As of 2020-12-16 I'm back to Solarized Light
(https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-solarized8)
I still find it this light background theme superior in clarity and
readability.

2021-04-01 Back to GruvBox, since Corona virus I'm spending a lot more time
behind the screen and the light themes are starting to come in too heavy on
the brain after hours of working.  Tried Nord first, but that was a tad too
limiting for coding.  Switched to Grubbox Material, which makes use of
Treesitter apparently for better coloring.



                                                                     *mustang*
Nice, but too green.
No visual distinction between variable and string (PHP); That's BAD.


                                                                    *newnoise*
Mainly red + grey, totally useless for day-to-day coding, but _very_ useful
when used with extreme small font size to get an overview of the structure of
the code.

                                                                     *Nord*
Like it a lot, light contrast, very easy on the eyes.  Maybe just a tad too
monochrome-like, but I'm fine with that.
The thing that made me go back to Grubbox was that Nord's way of highlighting
closed folds is basically unreadable, that really made it a 'no' for me.


                                                                   *solarized*
Punctuation marks are too bright, distracting from reading (dark version).

    I've given the light version a run for its money and must say I'm linking
    it quite a bit actually!  Very complete, better diff high lighting than
    zenburn, quickfix, gitcommit (with fugitive), etc...

    Still using it in light version, still liking it, still no intention to
    switch back to zenburn.

    Still in use all the time, will remove zenburn.


                                                             *tomorrow-night*
Calm and pleasing colors.
A lot of red, variables for instance.
ft=sql does not highlight?
No warning color change when editing GIT COMMIT message > 50 chars.


                                                                    *xoria256*
Dark, ok contrast, like working with it, unfortunately just little bit too
purple/pink for my taste.  Would probably still be using this if I didn't know
zenburn.
